<p align="center"> An R Package that improves workflow with using s::can spectrolyzer's default analyte output data format </p>

## üìôDescription

Following the guidance from STAT545 (UBC 2021W), this project will create functions into a package that can improve the workflow with using [S::Can spectro::lyser UV V2](https://www.s-can.at/products/spectrometer-probes) output datasets. 

For more information on this area of research: 

[UBC Ecohydrology](https://ecohydro.ires.ubc.ca/)

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
Raw spectrolyzer data used for the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/functions-BrianY-Wang/tree/main/Raw_data)

This project utilized the following libraries, many thanks to the developers üôè

[Tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)

[roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)

[testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html)


### Cloning the repository to run R scripts and access raw data
To download a copy of the repository onto your computer, follow these steps on a MAC:
1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Console (Windows)
2. Change directory (cd) to a path where you want the repository to be downloaded 
3. Type in "git clone -https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-BrianY-Wang"
4. The repository should be downloaded and each script can now be opened locally with R (Version 1.4.1717 or above)

### Repository Contents
- B1 folder containing source script (.Rmd), readme and knitted files 
- Raw_data folder containing unprocessed data output by the spectrolyzers 
- ".gitignore"", ".DS_Store"" and ".Rproj files"" are github and Rproject related files
